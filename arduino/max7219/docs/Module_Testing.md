This code controls four LED matrices (using the MAX7219 chip) through an Arduino or similar microcontroller. It leverages the `LedControl` library to manage the matrices. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how the code works:

### Libraries and Pin Configuration:
1. **`LedControl.h`**: This library is used to interface with the MAX7219 chip that controls LED matrices.
2. **Pin Configuration**:
   - `DATA_IN`: The data input pin for communication.
   - `CLK`: The clock pin to synchronize data transfer.
   - `CS`: The chip select pin to enable communication with the MAX7219.

### Setup:
- **Number of Devices**: The constant `NUM_DEVICES` is set to 4, indicating the code will handle four LED matrices.
- **LedControl Instance**: The `LedControl lc` object is created with the defined pins and the number of devices to manage.

In the `setup()` function:
- Each LED matrix is initialized:
  1. **Wake up** the MAX7219 (`shutdown(i, false)`) to activate the LED matrix.
  2. **Set brightness** (`setIntensity(i, 8)`) of each matrix to a medium level (8 out of 15).
  3. **Clear the display** (`clearDisplay(i)`) to ensure that all LEDs start in an off state.

### Loop:
In the `loop()` function, the following actions take place:
1. **Test each matrix individually**:
   - Clear the current matrix before performing any operations.
   - Iterate through each LED (8x8 grid) and turn each one on (`setLed`) for 100 milliseconds, then turn it off. This creates a visual effect where LEDs turn on one by one.
2. **Final check for each matrix**:
   - After individual LED testing, all LEDs in the matrix are turned on for 1 second using `setRow()`, which sets all 8 LEDs in each row on (`0xFF` means all bits are set).
   - The matrix is cleared again to reset.

3. **Pause and repeat**:
   - After testing all four matrices, the program waits 2 seconds (`delay(2000)`) before repeating the process.

### Summary:
- The program tests each LED in every matrix by turning them on and off in a sequential manner.
- After testing each matrix, all LEDs are turned on briefly for a final visual check.
- The process repeats after a 2-second pause.
