# IoT Projects Repository

Welcome to the **IoT Projects** repository! This repository contains a collection of Arduino and ESP8266 projects focusing on Internet of Things (IoT) applications. 

## Projects Overview

### Arduino
- **WS2811 LED Control**: Projects demonstrating how to control WS2811 LED strips.
- **MAX7219 LED Control**: Projects for controlling LED matrices with the MAX7219 chip.
